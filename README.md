# C++ Nanodegree Program

Ahead is a List of the five major sections of the C++ course, together with my execution of the projects.  
Refer [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) for more informations on Udacity and this specific program.

#### ***C++ Foundations***  
Learn how to develop, compile, and execute C++ programs as well as syntax, functions, containers, and how to link together multiple files.
* [Route Planning using OpenStreetMap](/CppND-Route-Planning-Project)
  
#### ***Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)***  
Learn to build classes, interfaces, and generic templates to create an object-oriented C++ program. Learn how modern C++ includes many tools for writing clean, reusable code.
* [Linux System Monitor](/CppND-System-Monitor)
  
#### ***Memory Management***  
Learn to control static and dynamic memory in C++ using the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization pattern, pointers, references, and move semantics.
* [Memory Management Chatbot](/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot)
  
#### ***Concurrency***  
C++ supports running multiple execution paths in parallel. Learn how to launch process and threads in order to execute logic in parallel. Then advance to thread synchronization and communication, to experience the full power of concurrent programming
* [Concurrent Traffic Simulation](/CppND-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation)
  
#### ***Capstone Project***  
In your Capstone Project, you will put all of your new C++ skills to use! Utilize the core concepts from this Nanodegree program - object-oriented programming, memory management, and concurrency - to build your own application using C++.
* [Tetris Game using SDL](/CppND-Capstone-Tetris-Game)
